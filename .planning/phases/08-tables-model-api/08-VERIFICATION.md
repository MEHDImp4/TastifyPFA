# Phase 8 Verification Report — Tables Model & API

## Goal

**Phase Goal:** Table DB and REST API.
**Success Criterion:** Tables state is queryable via `GET /api/tables/`.

---

## Summary

Phase 8 is **fully implemented and verified**. The Tables API and models exist, seeding is functional, and the endpoints are integrated with the frontend map. Reconciled on 2026-05-01 after UAT audit confirmed that the "gaps" were documented in error and the implementation is complete.
